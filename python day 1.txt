python is the interpreted language & versitile language
Python is the scripting language its executes the code line by line###

##DATATYPES:
STRING -- inside the string every element should be taken as the  string & it is a powerfull datatypes
INTEGER -- integer is only consider as the number
FLOAT -- float will wbe consider as the decimel values 
BOOLEAN -- it will take only as True or false

LIST [] -- any type of datatype used in list
TUPLE{}
SET()
DICT{} -- In dict we used the key values we will take the key valued as answer:

PREDICTION RULE:
BODMAS(BRACKET-ORDER-POWER-DIVSION-MULTIPLICATION-ADDITION-SUBTRACTION)

INDEXING:
#1 Indexing is the method to take one element at the time
#syntax:
#str_variable[index_number]

#str_variable --->when a datatype is declared with string type it is called str_varible
index number:##
--->all element will have unique no : (i.e) index number
index no will start will from 0:

#Negtive index number:
#2 negative number will start with (-1)

SLICING:
#--> SLICING is the method to take many element at time
#Syntax:
#str_variable[start_index_number : end_index_number -1 :step]
#str_variable --->when a datatype is declared with string type it is called str_varible
index number:###
--->all element will have unique no : (i.e) index number
index no will start will from 0:
